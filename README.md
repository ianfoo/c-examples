# I am not a C programmer.

Or at least, I'm not anymore. There was a time when I did produce C
and C++ output on a semi-regular basis or greater, but that was
some time ago, before AbstractThingamabobberFactoryFactoryImpl and such.

And so it came that programming was mentioned, and for some reason,
probably because the conversation was about colleges and computer
science programs, where I wrote a handful of C, I thought of C, and
awoke a desire to write a dumb little C program. So I wrote `fork.c`,
and it made me smile, so I decided to create a place to put dumb
little C programs if and when the inspiration struck me. The result
is this repository.
